# Nomad Keyboard

The Nomad is a 7Ã—5 keys, column-staggered split keyboard based largely on the [Sofle Choc by Brian Low](https://github.com/brianlow/SofleKeyboard), borrowing they physical layout from the [OMKBD ErgoDash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash).
It uses low profile Kailh Choc v1 switches with hotswap sockets and features per-key RGB lighting via SK6812 Mini-E LEDs.
Compared to the Sofle Choc the nomad offers an additional thumb cluster key, an additional modifier key in the 5th row and a 7th inner column with 3 keys each.
To make the keyboard more compact, there also is no option for a rotary encoder.
